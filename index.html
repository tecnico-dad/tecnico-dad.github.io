    <h2>Programming background</h2>

    
    <p>To implement the project you are required to have experience with the Java programming language and with the use GRPC in Java.</p>
    This is a pre-requisite to the course; no lectures will be given on thse topics.
    
    <p>If you have been a student of LEIC at IST, all the required background to do the project has been lectured in the "Distributed Systems" course.</p>
    
    <p>If you do not have previous experience with GRPC in Java you will be required to do self-study. We include below material that has been prepared to teach these subjects in the "Distributed Systems" course. We recommend that you do all thse extercises on your own.</p>
    
    
    <h2>Material taken from the "Distributed Systems" course at IST</h2>    

    <p>The following material is a copy of the material provided to students of the "Distributed Systems" course at IST. It is provided "as is".</p>
